## Core Capabilities

Power BI is Microsoft's BI platform, deeply integrated into the Microsoft 365 and Azure ecosystems. Its relevance to VariScout is as the enterprise BI tool that quality teams most commonly have access to, and as the platform whose slicer paradigm parallels Tableau's sidebar filters.

### Slicers

Power BI's primary filtering mechanism. Slicers are visual controls placed on report pages — dropdown lists, checkboxes, date ranges, numeric ranges, and relative date slicers. Sync slicers propagate filter state across multiple pages. The interaction model is identical in concept to Tableau's sidebar filters: the analyst configures the view by selecting values in slicer controls.

Slicers can be configured as single-select or multi-select, and can be set to apply across all visuals or specific visuals. The slicer pane (responsive slicer) collapses into a panel that expands on click, addressing some of the screen real estate concern on smaller displays.

### Cross-Filtering

Clicking a data point in one visual filters all other visuals on the page (configurable as cross-filter or cross-highlight). This is the same concept as Tableau's cross-filtering. The analyst sees how one selection affects other dimensions. However, cross-filtering is a dashboard interaction feature, not an investigation methodology — it shows correlated changes but doesn't quantify variation contribution.

### Small Multiples

Added to Power BI in 2021 as a standard visual option. The analyst drags a dimension to the "Small multiples" field well, and the selected chart type replicates across dimension values in a grid layout. Grid size adjusts automatically. This implementation is functional but less flexible than Tableau's rows/columns shelf approach — the grid layout options are more constrained.

### DAX Calculations

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is Power BI's formula language. It supports aggregation, filtering, time intelligence, and iterative calculations. Statistically, DAX can calculate means, medians, standard deviations, percentiles, and custom aggregations. However, there is no built-in ANOVA, regression, or capability analysis. Implementing Cpk or eta-squared in DAX is technically possible but requires significant expertise and produces fragile, hard-to-maintain measures.

### Custom Visuals (AppSource)

Power BI's marketplace includes third-party custom visuals. Basic control chart visuals exist (from providers like Nova Silva and others), offering I-MR, Xbar-R, and P charts. These are functional but limited — they typically lack Nelson rules, run tests, and linked filtering with other visuals. The quality and maintenance of third-party visuals varies.

### Excel Integration

Power BI integrates deeply with Excel. Data from Excel workbooks can be imported directly. Power BI reports can be embedded in Excel. This creates a potential overlap with VariScout's Excel Add-in — a quality team using Power BI might embed basic control charts in Excel reports without a separate tool. However, the SPC capabilities of Power BI (even with custom visuals) are superficial compared to a dedicated SPC tool.

### AI Features

Power BI includes Q&A (natural language queries), Key Influencers visual (automated factor analysis using ML), and Anomaly Detection. The Key Influencers visual is relevant: it identifies factors that influence a metric, somewhat similar to VariScout's eta-squared ranking. However, it uses ML classification/regression rather than ANOVA, doesn't integrate into an investigation workflow, and presents results as a static report rather than an interactive drill-down path.

## Analysis and Investigation Workflow

Power BI's workflow is **build-then-publish**:

1. The analyst (Pro/Premium user) connects to data in Power BI Desktop
2. They build data models with DAX measures
3. They create report pages with visuals and slicers
4. They publish reports to the Power BI Service
5. Consumers interact through slicers and cross-filtering

For variation investigation, a Power BI user would:

1. Import measurement data (from Excel, SQL, or other sources)
2. Build DAX measures for mean, standard deviation, and possibly control limits
3. Create bar charts or boxplots showing measurements by factor
4. Add slicers for each factor dimension
5. Optionally add a custom control chart visual from AppSource
6. Use slicers and cross-filtering to explore factor effects

The fundamental limitation: Power BI is a reporting tool, not an analysis tool. The investigation logic must be built by the report author through DAX measures and visual configuration. There is no guided investigation workflow. The consumer of the report applies filters and reads visual changes but has no statistical framework for interpreting what they see.

## How Power BI Addresses Our 6 Tensions

| Tension                  | Power BI's Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Assessment                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hierarchy Assumption** | Key Influencers visual performs automated factor analysis, but does not detect interactions between factors. DAX can calculate interaction terms but requires expert authoring.                                                               | Partially addressed through Key Influencers (main effects only); interactions not addressed.    |
| **Discoverability**      | Slicers make filter options visible. Sync slicers maintain filter state across pages. The responsive slicer pane provides a collapsible filter panel. Similar to Tableau's approach — all options visible but no guidance on which to select. | Addressed for filter discoverability; not addressed for analytical discoverability.             |
| **Factor Ordering**      | Key Influencers visual ranks factors by influence (using ML). However, the ranking is in a separate visual, not integrated with the investigation workflow. Standard slicers present all factors equally with no ordering.                    | Partially addressed through Key Influencers; not integrated into navigation.                    |
| **When to Stop**         | No stopping guidance. Reports are open-ended.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not addressed.                                                                                  |
| **Mobile Screen Budget** | Power BI Mobile app with phone-optimized layouts. Report authors can create phone-specific layouts with rearranged visuals. Slicers adapt to mobile but still consume screen space.                                                           | Better addressed than Tableau through phone-specific layouts; slicer space remains a challenge. |
| **Path Dependency**      | No drill-down path. Slicer selections are commutative — order doesn't matter.                                                                                                                                                                 | Not applicable — no sequential drill-down model.                                                |

## Strategic Implications for VariScout

### Where We Differentiate

- **SPC-native analysis**: Power BI has no native SPC capability. Custom visuals and DAX workarounds cannot replicate proper control chart logic, capability analysis, or ANOVA. VariScout is purpose-built for the statistical analysis that Power BI cannot perform.
- **Zero-configuration statistics**: Power BI requires a DAX expert to build statistical measures. VariScout calculates Cpk, eta-squared, and ANOVA automatically from the data.
- **Investigation workflow**: Power BI reports are static configurations that consumers interact with through slicers. VariScout's progressive stratification is an investigation methodology where each interaction drives the next analytical step.
- **Quality professional focus**: Power BI serves general business analytics. VariScout is designed specifically for quality practitioners — the terminology, workflow, and output match how quality professionals think about variation.

### What We Can Learn

- **Key Influencers visual**: Power BI's automated factor ranking visual demonstrates that even BI tools recognize the need to surface which factors matter. VariScout's eta-squared ranking is a better implementation for quality data (transparent statistics vs. ML black box), but the concept of visual factor ranking is validated by Power BI's inclusion of this feature.
- **Phone-specific layouts**: Power BI's approach to creating separate mobile layouts for the same report is a practical solution to the mobile screen budget tension. VariScout could adopt a similar approach for the PWA's mobile experience.
- **Responsive slicer pane**: The collapsible slicer pane demonstrates that even BI tools recognize sidebar filters consume too much screen space. This validates VariScout's rejection of the sidebar pattern.

### What to Avoid Adopting

- **Slicer paradigm**: The same reasoning as for Tableau applies. Slicers are configuration controls, not investigation actions. VariScout's chart-integrated filtering is a deliberate differentiation.
- **DAX complexity**: Power BI's reliance on DAX for anything beyond basic aggregations creates a barrier for quality professionals. VariScout should never require formula authoring for standard quality analyses.
- **Microsoft ecosystem lock-in**: While VariScout's Azure app runs in Azure and the Excel Add-in runs in Office, the analytical capability should remain platform-independent. The PWA works anywhere — this flexibility is a differentiator against Power BI's Microsoft-centric deployment.
