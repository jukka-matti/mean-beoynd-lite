# Design Spec: Investigation Mindmap

> Authoritative design specification for the Mindmap-first investigation UX. Consolidates four concept documents into a three-layer architecture that replaces the Funnel Panel ecosystem with one spatial view.

---

## 1. Three-Layer Architecture

The investigation UX consolidates into three layers with clear boundaries. No layer depends on the others being visible — each works independently but they compose into a coherent whole.

| Layer                   | Visibility     | Components                                                            | Role                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chart Layer**         | Always visible | Boxplot "↓ drill here", Pareto ranking, I-Chart patterns, Stats Panel | Primary workspace — the analyst reads data and acts on it              |
| **Navigation Layer**    | Always visible | FilterBreadcrumb (contribution %), VariationBar (cumulative %)        | Filter state — the analyst sees where they are in the investigation    |
| **Investigation Layer** | On demand      | Investigation Mindmap (slide-out panel or pop-out window)             | Strategic overview — the analyst plans next steps and reviews progress |

### Layer Boundaries

- **Chart Layer** owns the data visualization. Charts accept data via props and render the current filtered view. The Boxplot's "↓ drill here" label (`Boxplot.tsx:389`) is the Chart Layer's only guidance element — it points to the highest-η² bar.
- **Navigation Layer** owns filter state display. FilterBreadcrumb shows active filters with contribution % badges (color-coded: ≥50% green, ≥30% amber, <30% blue). VariationBar shows cumulative explained variation as a horizontal bar. These components exist today and require no changes.
- **Investigation Layer** owns the strategic overview. The Investigation Mindmap replaces the Funnel Panel as the on-demand companion view. It shows all factors spatially, the drill trail, and interaction relationships — information that the Chart and Navigation layers cannot convey because they show one factor at a time.

The three-layer architecture reduces the current PWA from 20+ guidance surfaces to three clearly scoped layers. The analyst knows where to look: charts for data, breadcrumbs for filter state, mindmap for investigation strategy.

## 2. Investigation Mindmap — Three Modes

The Mindmap has three switchable modes that share the same node layout but show different information. A mode toggle (segmented control) at the top of the mindmap switches between modes. Nodes stay fixed during transitions; only edges, annotations, and layout direction change.

### Drilldown Mode

The default mode. Shows the factor landscape and investigation path.

- **Factor nodes**: All categorical factors appear as nodes. Node size is proportional to η² (computed by `getEtaSquared()` in `stats.ts:177` against the current filtered subset). The factor explaining the most remaining variation is the largest node.
- **Node color encodes filter state**:
  - **Active filter** (e.g., Store = South): Solid fill, bright color. The filtered value appears as a label below the node.
  - **Available** (not yet filtered): Outlined, neutral fill. Hovering shows the η² value.
  - **Exhausted** (filtered, negligible remaining η²): Dimmed/grayed. Signals diminishing returns.
- **Drill trail**: A highlighted path connects nodes in drill order (Start → Store → Time_Slot). The path is the visual record of the investigation sequence.
- **Suggested-next node**: The factor with the highest η² among remaining (unfiltered) factors has a pulsing glow or "suggested" badge. This is the spatial equivalent of the Boxplot's "↓ drill here" label.
- **Click node → filter dropdown**: Clicking a node opens a popover listing that factor's category values with their contribution percentages. Selecting a value applies the filter. The main dashboard updates simultaneously.
- **Cumulative progress footer**: A persistent bar at the bottom shows cumulative explained variation (e.g., "58% of variation explained") with a 70% target marker. Source: `useVariationTracking` running sum.

### Interaction Mode

Same factor nodes in the same positions. Edges appear showing interaction relationships.

- **Edges between nodes**: Thickness proportional to interaction strength (ΔR² — the difference in R² between a model with and without the interaction term, computed by running `calculateMultipleRegression()` at `stats.ts:1886` twice).
- **Edge color encodes significance**: Bright/saturated for p < 0.05, muted/translucent for p < 0.10, absent for p ≥ 0.10.
- **Hover edge → tooltip**: Shows ΔR², standardized β, p-value, and a plain-language description (e.g., "Store and Time_Slot interact — the Dinner rush effect is stronger at Store South").
- **Click edge → multi-select**: Selects both connected factors for combined analysis in the Regression Panel.
- **No edges visible** is itself informative: "Your factors don't interact significantly — the sequential drill-down captured the main effects."
- **Computation**: Interaction scan runs on demand when the analyst switches to Interaction Mode (not on data load). For N factors, this is N×(N−1)/2 regression pairs. For the typical 3–5 factor dataset, this is 3–10 pairs — fast enough for interactive use.

### Narrative Mode

The spatial layout reorganizes into a linear timeline for stakeholder communication.

- **Timeline layout**: Nodes appear sequentially (horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile) in drill order. Each node is a "step" in the investigation story.
- **Step annotations**: Each step shows key findings from that drill point:
  - Factor name and filtered value (e.g., "Step 1: Store = South")
  - Variation explained (η² from `useVariationTracking`)
  - Key statistic change (mean shift, Cpk change from before/after `calculateStats`)
  - Cumulative explained variation at that point
- **Interaction cross-connections**: If significant interactions were detected, they appear as cross-links between timeline steps (e.g., a dashed arc between Store and Time_Slot steps).
- **Cumulative progress**: A running bar along the timeline shows explained variation building at each step.
- **Conclusion panel**: At the end of the timeline, a summary: "Two factors explain 60% of delivery time variation."
- **Export**: PNG/SVG image export. The analyst can paste the image into slides or reports. This is the MVP export format.
- **Annotations**: The analyst can optionally add text notes to each step (e.g., "Store South uses contract drivers"). Annotations are stored locally and included in exports.

### Mode Switch Interaction

| From                    | To                                                         | Transition                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Drilldown → Interaction | Nodes stay fixed; edges fade in                            | Analyst wants to check factor-pair relationships             |
| Drilldown → Narrative   | Nodes reorganize into timeline; trail becomes the sequence | Analyst is done investigating, wants to communicate findings |
| Interaction → Drilldown | Edges fade out; nodes regain drill-state coloring          | Analyst returns to investigation after checking interactions |
| Interaction → Narrative | Edges fade, nodes reorganize into timeline                 | Analyst wants to include interaction findings in the story   |
| Narrative → Drilldown   | Timeline collapses back to spatial layout                  | Analyst wants to resume investigating                        |

## 3. What the Mindmap Replaces

The Funnel Panel ecosystem (`VariationFunnel.tsx` — 965 lines, `FunnelPanel.tsx`, `FunnelWindow.tsx`, `InteractionGuidance.tsx`) currently provides investigation guidance through dense, everything-at-once presentation. The Mindmap replaces this with progressive disclosure.

### Element-by-Element Replacement Map

| Current Funnel Element                        | Location                                        | Mindmap Equivalent                                           | How It Improves                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Factor ranking list** (η² bars, sorted)     | `VariationFunnel.tsx:96–123`                    | Node size encodes η² ranking spatially                       | Spatial layout is scannable at a glance; no scrolling through a list          |
| **Factor selection checkboxes**               | `VariationFunnel.tsx:126–129, 288–298`          | Click node → filter dropdown                                 | Direct manipulation replaces checkbox+apply two-step                          |
| **"Highest impact" label + Drill button**     | `VariationFunnel.tsx:635–647`                   | Suggested-next node (pulsing glow)                           | Spatial emphasis is more visible than a text label in a list                  |
| **"Worst" red label**                         | `VariationFunnel.tsx:727–728`                   | Red-tinted category in click-popover; contribution % visible | On-demand detail replaces always-visible label                                |
| **Inline Cpk badge** (improvement projection) | `VariationFunnel.tsx:737–767`                   | Removed — moves to WhatIfSimulator (separate page)           | Cpk projection is a "what if" scenario, not an investigation guidance element |
| **Cumulative explained summary**              | `VariationFunnel.tsx:267–283`                   | Cumulative progress footer in all three modes                | Always visible at bottom of mindmap, not buried in a list header              |
| **Category-level μ/σ/% density table**        | `VariationFunnel.tsx:183–189` (expanded rows)   | Available on hover/click in Drilldown Mode popover           | Progressive disclosure: shown when requested, not always                      |
| **WhatIfSimulator** (embedded)                | `VariationFunnel.tsx:25–28, 139–143`            | Moves to separate page (see Section 4)                       | Separated mental modes: investigation ≠ scenario modeling                     |
| **InteractionGuidance** (text prompt)         | `InteractionGuidance.tsx:26`                    | Interaction Mode replaces text with visual evidence          | Edges show _whether_ interactions exist, not just _that they might_           |
| **Pop-out window sync**                       | `FunnelWindow.tsx` (localStorage + postMessage) | Reused for Mindmap pop-out window                            | Same bidirectional sync pattern, new content                                  |
| **Slide-out panel shell**                     | `FunnelPanel.tsx` (backdrop, escape-to-close)   | Reused for Mindmap slide-out panel                           | Same panel infrastructure, new content                                        |

### What Gets Explicitly Removed

These Funnel elements are not replicated in the Mindmap because they contribute to the density problem:

| Removed Element                                       | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dual checkboxes** (select factor + select category) | The Funnel required selecting which factors to include, then expanding to select categories. The Mindmap shows all factors by default (nodes) and uses click-to-drill for categories. No two-step selection needed.                                                          |
| **Inline Cpk badges** on category rows                | Cpk projection per-category is a scenario modeling feature (what if we removed this category?). This belongs in the WhatIfSimulator, not in the investigation overview.                                                                                                      |
| **Category-level μ/σ/% always-visible density**       | In the Funnel, expanding a factor showed a table of every category with mean, std dev, and % of data. This is useful but dense. The Mindmap's click-popover shows category contribution % (the actionable metric) on demand. Full stats remain available in the Stats Panel. |
| **"Standardize to best" presets**                     | These WhatIfSimulator presets generated from category stats move with the simulator to its own page.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Excluded-category tracking**                        | The Funnel allowed checking/unchecking categories to see projected stats. This is WhatIfSimulator territory.                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Net Effect

The Funnel Panel presents ~15 interactive elements per factor row (checkbox, expand button, category checkboxes, drill button, Cpk badge, worst label, μ/σ/% per category). For 3 factors with 3–7 categories each, this is **60–150 interactive elements** in a 320px-wide panel.

The Mindmap presents 3–5 factor nodes with hover tooltips and click-popovers. The default view has **3–5 interactive elements** plus the mode toggle and progress footer. Detail is available on demand, not by default.

---

## 4. WhatIfSimulator as Separate Page

The WhatIfSimulator (`WhatIfSimulator.tsx` — currently embedded in the Funnel Panel and available standalone in Azure) moves to its own page/view, accessible from the Settings menu or a dedicated route.

### Rationale

Investigation and scenario modeling are distinct mental modes:

- **Investigation** (Mindmap): "What is causing the variation?" — exploratory, analytical, drilling into data to identify root causes. The analyst is _reading_ the process.
- **Scenario modeling** (WhatIfSimulator): "What if we fixed it?" — projective, hypothetical, adjusting parameters to estimate improvement. The analyst is _imagining_ a different process.

Embedding the WhatIfSimulator inside the Funnel Panel conflated these modes. The analyst would drill into a factor, see the "worst" category, then immediately see a Cpk projection for removing it — before finishing the investigation. The separate page enforces a natural workflow: investigate first, then model improvements.

### Access Pattern

- **Route**: `/whatif` or equivalent in-app navigation
- **Entry points**: (1) Settings/tools menu, (2) "Model improvements" button at the end of a Narrative Mode timeline, (3) direct link from FilterBreadcrumb context menu
- **Data flow**: The WhatIfSimulator receives the current process statistics (mean, stdDev, Cpk) and spec limits from the DataContext. It does not need the investigation state — it operates on the filtered data as-is.
- **Presets**: The "Exclude worst category" and "Standardize to best" presets (currently generated in `VariationFunnel.tsx:192–265`) move to the WhatIfSimulator page. They are generated from the current filtered data, not from the mindmap state.

---

## 5. Statistical Foundation

The Mindmap's three modes are powered by two statistical engines already present in `@variscout/core`, plus one new infrastructure requirement.

### Existing: η² for Node Sizing and Drill Ranking

`getEtaSquared(data, factor, outcome)` at `stats.ts:177` computes one-way ANOVA eta-squared (η² = SS_between / SS_total). This is the primary metric for:

- **Node size**: Larger η² → larger node. The visual hierarchy directly encodes statistical importance.
- **Suggested-next**: The factor with the highest η² among unfiltered factors gets the pulsing suggestion.
- **Cumulative tracking**: `useVariationTracking` (in `packages/hooks/src/useVariationTracking.ts`) maintains the running cumulative η² that powers the progress footer.

η² values are computed per-factor against the current filtered subset, so they update dynamically as the analyst drills. This is the existing behavior — no changes needed.

### Existing: Regression for Interaction Edges

`calculateMultipleRegression(data, outcome, [factor1, factor2], { includeInteractions: true })` at `stats.ts:1886` computes interaction effects. The returned `CoefficientResult` objects include `standardizedBeta`, `tStatistic`, and `pValue` for each interaction term.

For Interaction Mode edges:

- **Edge thickness**: ΔR² = R²_full − R²_main (run `calculateMultipleRegression` twice — once with `includeInteractions: false`, once with `true`). This is a ~10-line utility function (see [Design Brief §1](design-brief-guided-investigation.md#1-statistical-methodology) for specification).
- **Edge color**: Based on the interaction term's p-value from the full model.
- **Tooltip content**: ΔR², largest |standardized β| among interaction terms, p-value.

### New Infrastructure: Drill-Path Recording

All three Mindmap modes require a recorded sequence of drill steps. This does not exist today — the current filter stack (`useFilterNavigation`) tracks _what_ is filtered but not the _order_ or _statistics at each step_.

The drill-path recording system needs to capture, for each drill step:

| Field                     | Source                                    | Used By                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Factor name               | Filter action                             | All three modes                                                 |
| Filtered value(s)         | Filter action                             | Drilldown Mode (node labels), Narrative Mode (step annotations) |
| η² at time of drill       | `getEtaSquared()` on pre-drill data       | Narrative Mode (step annotations)                               |
| Cumulative η² after drill | `useVariationTracking`                    | Narrative Mode (progress bar)                                   |
| Mean before/after         | `calculateStats()` on pre/post-drill data | Narrative Mode (statistic change)                               |
| Cpk before/after          | `calculateStats()` on pre/post-drill data | Narrative Mode (capability change)                              |
| Timestamp                 | System clock                              | Narrative Mode (ordering)                                       |

This recording can be built as a new hook (`useDrillPath`) or as an extension to `useFilterNavigation`. The data is ephemeral (session-only) and lightweight (~100 bytes per drill step). Implementation detail is deferred to the coding phase.

## 6. Platform Strategy — PWA and Azure Only

The Investigation Mindmap is a **PWA + Azure feature only**. The Excel Add-in has a fundamentally different interaction model (native Excel slicers) and doesn't use the progressive drill-down workflow that the Mindmap visualizes.

### PWA

- **Panel model**: Slide-out panel from the right side, occupying the same slot as the current Funnel Panel. Reuses the `FunnelPanel.tsx` shell (backdrop, escape-to-close, outside-click-to-close).
- **Pop-out window**: Available as an option. Reuses the `FunnelWindow.tsx` bidirectional sync pattern (localStorage + postMessage). The analyst can drag the Mindmap to a second monitor while the main dashboard stays on the primary screen.
- **Modes available**: Drilldown Mode (full), Interaction Mode (full), Narrative Mode (view only — PNG export limited to screenshot).
- **Trigger**: The existing funnel icon in the header opens the Mindmap panel instead of the Funnel Panel.

### Azure

- **Panel model**: Same slide-out panel as PWA.
- **Split-pane option**: On desktop (viewport > 1280px), the Mindmap can open as a persistent side panel alongside the dashboard. This is appropriate for Azure's desktop-oriented professional workflow.
- **Pop-out window**: Same as PWA.
- **Modes available**: All three modes with full functionality.
- **Narrative export**: Full PNG/SVG export, designed for team presentations (Olivia's use case). Annotations are saved with the project (OneDrive sync).

### Excel Add-in — Explicitly Excluded

The Excel Add-in uses native Excel slicers for filtering. There is no progressive drill-down workflow, no filter breadcrumbs, no cumulative η² tracking. The Mindmap concept does not apply to the slicer interaction model. The Excel Add-in's investigation workflow is: set slicer values → read chart → adjust slicers. This is fundamentally different from the PWA/Azure drill-down-and-refine workflow.

### Narrative Export by Platform

| Capability             | PWA (free)                 | Azure (paid)                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| View Narrative Mode    | Yes                        | Yes                           |
| PNG export             | Basic (browser screenshot) | Full (high-resolution render) |
| SVG export             | No                         | Yes                           |
| Annotations            | Session-only (not saved)   | Saved with project (OneDrive) |
| Template customization | No                         | Future (post-MVP)             |

---

## 7. Progressive Disclosure Design

The Mindmap's core design principle is progressive disclosure — the answer to the Funnel Panel's density problem. The Funnel showed everything simultaneously; the Mindmap shows information in layers activated by user intent.

### Disclosure Levels

| Level                 | Trigger         | What Appears                                                                        | Cognitive Load                          |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Default view**      | Panel opens     | Factor nodes + drill trail + progress footer                                        | Low — 3–5 nodes, one trail, one bar     |
| **Hover**             | Mouse over node | Factor name, η² value, current filter value (if active)                             | Low — single tooltip                    |
| **Click**             | Click on node   | Popover with category values, contribution % per category, "drill" action per value | Moderate — one factor's detail          |
| **Mode switch**       | Toggle control  | Drilldown ↔ Interaction ↔ Narrative                                                 | Moderate — changes the information lens |
| **Interaction hover** | Mouse over edge | ΔR², p-value, plain-language description                                            | Moderate — single interaction detail    |

### What Is Never Shown Simultaneously

The following information was shown simultaneously in the Funnel Panel and is now gated behind progressive disclosure:

- All category statistics (μ, σ, %) for all factors — only shown for one factor at a time, on click
- Dual checkboxes (factor-level + category-level) — eliminated entirely
- Inline Cpk badges per category — moved to WhatIfSimulator
- "Worst" labels on every category row — replaced by contribution % color-coding in click-popover
- WhatIfSimulator presets — moved to separate page

### Visual Hierarchy

In Drilldown Mode, the visual hierarchy is:

1. **Node size** — the dominant signal. Largest node = most variation explained. Scannable in <1 second.
2. **Node color/fill** — active (filled) vs. available (outlined) vs. exhausted (dimmed). Filter state at a glance.
3. **Drill trail** — the path through the nodes. Investigation history visible as a highlighted line.
4. **Suggested-next pulse** — draws attention to the recommended next factor. Subtle but discoverable.
5. **Progress footer** — cumulative %. Always visible but not competing with the spatial layout.

In Interaction Mode, the hierarchy shifts:

1. **Edge thickness** — the dominant signal. Thickest edge = strongest interaction.
2. **Edge color** — significance encoding. Bright = statistically significant.
3. **Node size** — secondary context (η² for main effects).

In Narrative Mode, the hierarchy is temporal:

1. **Timeline position** — left-to-right sequence of drill steps.
2. **Step annotations** — findings at each step.
3. **Cumulative progress bar** — building total along the timeline.

## 8. Demo Walkthrough — Pizza Delivery with Mindmap UX

This walkthrough uses the Pizza Delivery dataset (`packages/data/src/samples/pizza.ts`) — 252 observations, 3 factors (Store, Time_Slot, Day), outcome Delivery_Time_min. It revises the [Investigation Flow Map](investigation-flow-map.md) walkthrough to show the Mindmap-first UX.

### Step 1: Data Loaded

**Chart Layer**: I-Chart shows delivery times with control limits. Boxplot shows Store groups — Store South's box is wider and higher. "↓ drill here" appears on Store South. Pareto ranks out-of-spec frequency by Store.

**Navigation Layer**: No active filters. VariationBar shows 0% explained.

**Investigation Layer (if opened)**: Three factor nodes — Store (large, ~40% η²), Time_Slot (medium, ~20% η²), Day (small, ~3% η²). Store node pulses as suggested-next. No drill trail. Progress footer: "0% explained."

_Compared to Flow Map Step 1_: The Mindmap immediately shows the factor landscape — three nodes with visual hierarchy. The analyst sees that Store dominates before touching anything. Previously, this required opening the hidden Funnel Panel.

### Step 2: Analyst Drills Store South

The analyst clicks the Store node in the Mindmap → popover shows: North (15%), Central (12%), South (45%). Analyst clicks "South" → filter applied.

**Chart Layer**: I-Chart filters to Store South. Boxplot now shows Time_Slot groups. "↓ drill here" on Dinner.

**Navigation Layer**: FilterBreadcrumb shows "Store: South 45%". VariationBar shows ~40%.

**Investigation Layer**: Store node fills solid (active). Trail: Start → Store. Time_Slot node is now the largest remaining (highest η² on filtered data). Time_Slot pulses as suggested-next. Day remains small. Progress footer: "40% explained."

_Compared to Flow Map Step 2_: The analyst can drill from the Mindmap or the Boxplot — both paths are valid. The Mindmap shows Time_Slot as the clear next candidate without requiring the analyst to open the Funnel Panel.

### Step 3: Analyst Drills Time_Slot Dinner

The analyst clicks the Time_Slot node → popover shows: Lunch (8%), Dinner (25%), Late Night (5%). Analyst clicks "Dinner."

**Chart Layer**: I-Chart filters to Store South + Dinner. Boxplot shows Day groups (roughly even).

**Navigation Layer**: Two chips: "Store: South 45%" and "Time_Slot: Dinner 25%". VariationBar shows ~58%.

**Investigation Layer**: Store and Time_Slot nodes filled. Trail: Start → Store → Time_Slot. Day node is small and dimmed (low η², ~3%). No suggestion pulse (remaining factors are weak). Progress footer: "58% explained."

_Compared to Flow Map Step 3_: Previously, the analyst would open the Funnel Panel to see the investigation state. Now the Mindmap shows the same information spatially — two filled nodes, one dimmed, trail visible.

### Step 4: Analyst Checks Interactions

Curious whether Store and Time_Slot interact, the analyst toggles to Interaction Mode.

**Investigation Layer**: Same three nodes. An edge appears between Store and Time_Slot — medium thickness (moderate ΔR²), bright color (p < 0.05). No significant edges for Store–Day or Time_Slot–Day. Hovering the edge: "Store × Time_Slot: ΔR² = 0.05, p = 0.02. The Dinner rush effect is stronger at Store South."

_Compared to Flow Map Steps 4 + 6_: Previously, the analyst saw a text-only InteractionGuidance prompt, then had to navigate to the Regression Panel, configure it, and read coefficient tables. Now the interaction is visible as a single edge — one glance instead of a multi-step workflow.

### Step 5: Analyst Decides to Stop

Back in Drilldown Mode, the analyst sees: 58% explained, Day is dimmed (3% η²), no strong suggestion. The progress footer shows the 70% target marker is ahead but the remaining factors are weak.

The analyst decides the investigation has found the key drivers (Store South + Dinner rush) and toggles to Narrative Mode.

### Step 6: Narrative Mode — Communication

**Investigation Layer**: Timeline appears:

- **Step 1**: Store = South — "Explains 40% of variation. Mean delivery time: 35 min vs. 28 min overall."
- **Step 2**: Time_Slot = Dinner — "Explains 25% of remaining variation. Dinner adds +7 min average."
- **Interaction note**: Dashed arc between steps — "Store × Time_Slot interaction (p = 0.02). Dinner rush at Store South is 2× worse than other stores."
- **Conclusion**: "Two factors explain 58% of delivery time variation. Day has no significant effect."

The analyst adds an annotation to Step 1: "Store South uses contract drivers with less route knowledge." Exports as PNG for the team meeting.

_Compared to Flow Map Step 7_: Previously, the investigation ended without ceremony — no summary, no exportable artifact. Now the Narrative Mode creates a presentation-ready visual story.

## 9. Competitive Positioning

No competitor offers a spatial investigation overview. The Investigation Mindmap is a genuine differentiator — and critically, it is a **consolidation** (fewer surfaces, less cognitive load) rather than a feature addition.

### What Competitors Offer

| Competitor   | Factor Exploration                                         | Investigation Overview                       | Presentation Output                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Minitab**  | Menu-driven ANOVA, stepwise regression. No visual ranking. | Session Window (text log). No spatial view.  | Manual PowerPoint.                    |
| **JMP**      | Effect Summary ranks by LogWorth. Model-first.             | Journal (command replay). No spatial view.   | JMP Journal export.                   |
| **Tableau**  | Sidebar filters, equal-weight checkboxes.                  | Dashboard shows current state, not journey.  | Story Points (manual slide sequence). |
| **Power BI** | Slicer paradigm. Key Influencers auto-ranks.               | Decomposition Tree (enforced top-down tree). | Report export.                        |
| **EDAScout** | Smart Cards, AI chatbot.                                   | Chat transcript (verbose, not visual).       | No export.                            |

See [competitor benchmarks](competitive/) for detailed assessments.

### VariScout's Unique Position

The Mindmap combines three capabilities no competitor has together:

1. **Spatial factor overview** — factors as nodes sized by statistical importance (η²), not a flat list or tree.
2. **Investigation state tracking** — the drill trail shows where the analyst has been, suggested-next shows where to go.
3. **Interaction overlay** — edges show factor-pair relationships without requiring a separate analysis step.

This is achieved through consolidation. The current Funnel Panel has more UI elements than most competitors' entire factor analysis workflow — but those elements are hidden, dense, and PWA-only. The Mindmap surfaces the same statistical insights through a simpler, spatial interface available on both PWA and Azure.

## 10. Design Questions for UI/UX Phase

These questions must be resolved during the UI/UX design phase before implementation begins.

### Node Layout

1. **Layout algorithm**: Should nodes use a radial layout (factors arranged in a circle around a center "start" node), a hierarchical layout (top-to-bottom by η² ranking), or force-directed-lite (spring forces with fixed positions after initial layout)? Radial is simplest to implement (static SVG positioning). Hierarchical matches the ranking mental model. Force-directed is most flexible but requires a physics engine.

2. **Node count limit**: With 3–5 factors, any layout works. At 8+ factors (possible in Azure with complex datasets), does the spatial layout become cluttered? Should there be a threshold where the layout switches to a compact list fallback?

### Mode Switch

3. **Discoverability**: How does the analyst discover that Interaction Mode and Narrative Mode exist? Options: (a) segmented control always visible at the top, (b) icon toggle that reveals modes on hover, (c) contextual prompt ("You've drilled 2 factors — check for interactions?"). The segmented control is most discoverable but takes space.

### Click-Popover

4. **Category count limit**: When a factor has 7+ categories (e.g., Day of week), does the click-popover become too long? Should it scroll, paginate, or show only the top N categories by contribution? The Pizza dataset's "Day" factor has 7 levels — a good test case.

### Mobile

5. **Mobile adaptation**: On mobile viewports (<768px), should the Mindmap open as a full-screen overlay (replacing the dashboard temporarily) or remain a slide-out panel? The current FunnelPanel uses a 320px slide-out which leaves no space for chart interaction. Full-screen mode gives the Mindmap room but breaks the "mindmap beside charts" spatial memory.

### Export

6. **Narrative export MVP**: Is PNG-only sufficient for the first release? SVG would allow lossless scaling but is less familiar to users. Should copy-to-clipboard (as image) be prioritized over file-save for the "paste into slides" workflow?

## 11. Design Thinking History

This spec consolidates four concept documents written during the design exploration phase. Each contributed specific ideas that are now incorporated into the Mindmap-first architecture.

| Document                                                       | What It Contributed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This simplifies the architecture (one component, three views) and leverages the shared node layout. |

The four documents are kept in `docs/01-vision/evaluations/` as historical design thinking. They should not be used as implementation references — this spec is the authoritative source for the Mindmap UX.

## 12. Implementation Phasing

The Mindmap ships mode-by-mode. Each phase is self-contained and shippable; each builds on the previous phase's infrastructure.

### Phase A: Infrastructure + Drilldown Mode

Ships first. Replaces the Funnel Panel with a spatial investigation view.

**New infrastructure:**

| Component             | Scope                                                                                                         | Estimate       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `useDrillPath` hook   | Records drill steps with before/after stats (factor, filtered value, η², cumulative η², mean, Cpk, timestamp) | ~100 lines     |
| Mindmap SVG component | Static radial or hierarchical layout of factor nodes                                                          | ~300–500 lines |

**Drilldown Mode features:**

- **Node rendering**: Size proportional to η² (via `getEtaSquared()`), color by filter state (active/available/exhausted), factor labels
- **Drill trail**: Highlighted path through nodes in drill order (Start → Store → Time_Slot)
- **Suggested-next**: Pulsing glow on the highest-η² remaining node
- **Click-popover**: Category values with contribution %, drill action per value
- **Cumulative progress footer**: Running η² bar with 70% target marker

**Reuses existing infrastructure:**

- `FunnelPanel.tsx` shell (slide-out, backdrop, escape-to-close) → `MindmapPanel.tsx`
- `FunnelWindow.tsx` sync pattern (localStorage + postMessage) → `MindmapWindow.tsx`
- `useVariationTracking` (η² data, cumulative tracking)
- `getEtaSquared()` (node sizing)

**Replaces:** Funnel icon in the header opens the Mindmap instead of the Funnel Panel. The Funnel Panel remains in the codebase until the Mindmap is validated, then is removed.

### Phase B: Interaction Mode

Adds edge rendering to the existing node layout. Requires Phase A's nodes and SVG component.

**New infrastructure:**

| Component                         | Scope                                                                                              | Estimate  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `getInteractionStrength()` helper | Utility in `@variscout/core`: ΔR² = R²_full − R²_main (runs `calculateMultipleRegression()` twice) | ~10 lines |

**Interaction Mode features:**

- **Edge rendering**: SVG paths between factor nodes, thickness proportional to ΔR², color by p-value (bright for p < 0.05, muted for p < 0.10, absent for p ≥ 0.10)
- **Edge tooltips**: ΔR², standardized β, p-value, plain-language description
- **Mode toggle**: Segmented control at top of Mindmap (Drilldown / Interaction)

**Reuses:**

- `calculateMultipleRegression()` with `includeInteractions: true/false` (existing in `stats.ts:1886`)
- Phase A's node layout, SVG component, and panel shell

### Phase C: Narrative Mode + WhatIfSimulator Separation

Adds timeline layout and export. Requires Phase A's drill trail data and Phase B's edge data for interaction cross-connections.

**New infrastructure:**

| Component                       | Scope                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Timeline layout                 | Reorganize nodes into horizontal (desktop) / vertical (mobile) sequence |
| Step annotations                | η², mean shift, Cpk change per step from `useDrillPath` recorded data   |
| Interaction cross-connections   | Dashed arcs between timeline steps from Phase B edge data               |
| Conclusion panel                | Summary text generated from drill-path statistics                       |
| PNG export                      | Canvas/SVG-to-PNG rendering for stakeholder presentations               |
| WhatIfSimulator standalone page | New route `/whatif`, presets migrated from `VariationFunnel.tsx`        |

**Mode toggle expands** to three segments (Drilldown / Interaction / Narrative).

### Phase D: Polish + Azure Enhancements

Platform-specific refinements. No new modes.

- **Azure split-pane option**: Persistent side panel alongside dashboard on viewport > 1280px
- **Annotations**: Text input per timeline step (Azure: saved to OneDrive with project; PWA: session-only)
- **SVG export**: Azure only (lossless scaling for team presentations)
- **"Model improvements" button**: At end of Narrative timeline → links to WhatIfSimulator at `/whatif`

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase A (Drilldown Mode)
  └─→ Phase B (Interaction Mode)  — needs A's nodes + SVG component
        └─→ Phase C (Narrative Mode) — needs A's drill trail + B's edges
              └─→ Phase D (Polish)     — needs all three modes complete
```

### What This Phasing Subsumes

The original evaluations index proposed a four-phase sequence (Factor Suggestion → Interaction Heatmap → Investigation Mindmap → Factor Map). The Mindmap-first architecture consolidates this:

- **Factor Suggestion** (old Phase 1) is subsumed by the suggested-next node in Drilldown Mode (Phase A). The pulsing glow on the highest-η² node provides the same guidance without a separate feature.
- **Interaction Heatmap** (old Phase 2) is subsumed by Interaction Mode edges (Phase B). Visual edges between nodes replace the standalone heatmap component.
- **Factor Map** (old Phase 4) is no longer needed. The Mindmap _is_ a lighter-weight Factor Map with three focused modes instead of one dense visualization.

The Mindmap consolidates rather than adding surfaces.
