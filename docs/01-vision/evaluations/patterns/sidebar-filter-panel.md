# Sidebar Filter Panel

> An always-visible panel listing all factors with checkboxes and sliders, Tableau-style.

## The Concept

A persistent sidebar (or bottom panel on mobile) that lists all categorical and continuous factors with checkboxes for levels, sliders for ranges, and search/filter within each factor. This is the dominant pattern in BI tools: Tableau, Power BI, Looker, and most dashboard platforms use a filter panel that's always visible alongside the visualization area.

The advantage is complete discoverability: every filter option is visible at all times, no clicking required to discover what's available. The analyst can see the full factor landscape at a glance, apply multiple filters simultaneously, and understand the complete filtering state without reading chips or navigating to a funnel view.

The trade-off is analytical flow. VariScout's current design integrates filtering into the chart interaction itself --- you click a boxplot bar because you _see_ the variation there, and the click-to-filter action is a direct response to the visual pattern. A sidebar panel separates the "seeing" from the "acting": the analyst reads patterns in the chart area and manages filters in a separate panel. This disconnect breaks the tight feedback loop that makes progressive stratification feel like investigation rather than dashboard configuration.

Additionally, a sidebar panel doesn't naturally show eta-squared or contribution percentages. It's a filter management UI, not an analysis UI. The analyst would need to read the boxplot for eta-squared information and then apply that knowledge in the sidebar, adding a cognitive transfer step that doesn't exist in the current click-to-drill design.

## Tensions Addressed

- [Discoverability](../tensions/discoverability.md) --- Completely resolves. All filter options are always visible.
- [Mobile Screen Budget](../tensions/mobile-screen-budget.md) --- Worsens on mobile. A persistent sidebar consumes significant screen real estate on narrow screens.

## Philosophy Alignment

- **EDA for process improvement**: Partially conflicts. The sidebar treats filtering as a configuration task rather than an investigation step. The analyst manages filters instead of _investigating_ through filters.
- **Guided frustration pedagogy**: Conflicts. A sidebar presents all options at once, removing the progressive discovery that builds understanding. The analyst doesn't need to "find" where variation is --- they just check boxes.
- **Four Lenses coordination**: Weakens. The current design means filtering _is_ interacting with a lens. A sidebar decouples filtering from lens interaction, reducing the sense that the four charts are connected investigation tools.
- **Two Voices**: Neutral. Filter management is orthogonal to the process-voice/customer-voice distinction.

## Persona Impact

| Persona         | Effect   | Why                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Green Belt Gary | Neutral  | Gary is comfortable with both interaction models. He might prefer the sidebar's familiarity from Tableau/Power BI experience but would lose the analytical integration. |
| Student Sara    | Negative | Sara needs to learn progressive stratification, not dashboard filtering. A sidebar teaches a BI workflow, not an EDA methodology.                                       |
| OpEx Olivia     | Neutral  | Olivia's team may find the sidebar more familiar if they come from Tableau/Power BI backgrounds. But familiarity isn't the same as effectiveness.                       |
| Trainer Tina    | Negative | Tina explicitly teaches the investigation-through-charts approach. A sidebar contradicts her methodology and makes it harder to demonstrate the Sock Mystery journey.   |
| Evaluator Erik  | Neutral  | Erik checks for filter capability on a feature list. Both approaches satisfy the requirement; the interaction model doesn't affect his evaluation.                      |
| Curious Carlos  | Positive | Carlos is used to filter panels from consumer apps. A sidebar is immediately understandable, reducing the learning curve for first-time users.                          |

## Platform Fit

| Platform            | Fit     | Notes                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PWA (free training) | Poor    | Conflicts with the educational mission. The PWA should teach progressive stratification, not replicate Tableau.                                     |
| Azure (paid team)   | Neutral | Could be offered as an alternative view for teams migrating from Tableau/Power BI. But it undermines the methodology that differentiates VariScout. |
| Excel Add-in        | N/A     | The Excel Add-in already uses native Excel slicers, which serve the sidebar filter function.                                                        |

## Competitive Landscape

- **Tableau**: Sidebar filters are the defining interaction model — dropdowns, checkboxes, sliders, and date ranges alongside the visualization area. Cross-filtering between dashboard sheets provides immediate visual feedback. Quick filters update charts as selections change. This is the paradigm that millions of users know, and the paradigm that VariScout's chart-integrated filtering deliberately rejects. See [Tableau Benchmark](../competitive/tableau-benchmark.md).
- **Power BI**: Slicers serve the same function as Tableau's sidebar filters — visual controls for filtering dimensions, with sync groups that propagate selections across pages. The responsive slicer pane collapses into a panel that expands on click, acknowledging that persistent filter controls consume too much screen space. Cross-filtering between visuals mirrors Tableau's behavior. See [Power BI Benchmark](../competitive/powerbi-benchmark.md).
- **Looker**: Uses a filter bar at the top of dashboards with dropdowns for each filterable dimension. Filters are defined through LookML (Looker's modeling language) and exposed to dashboard consumers, adding a governance layer. The interaction pattern is consistent with Tableau and Power BI — always-visible filter controls that the analyst configures. See [Minor Competitors](../competitive/minor-competitors.md).
- **EDAScout**: The `CategoryGrid` component inside `SubgroupExplorerModal` is their closest equivalent --- an always-visible grid of category cards with variance-derived coloring from ANOVA. Unlike a traditional sidebar, it opens as a modal overlay rather than being persistently visible. Filters are modal-scoped and do not persist across page navigation. The variance coloring uses within-group SS (how internally noisy each group is), which is conceptually misleading for variation source identification. See [EDAScout Benchmark](../competitive/edascout-benchmark.md).

Adopting a sidebar would make VariScout more familiar but less distinctive. The current chart-integrated filtering is a competitive differentiator precisely because it's different from the Tableau model. EDAScout's modal-based approach demonstrates the middle ground (a dedicated filter UI that's not always visible) but still suffers from separating the "seeing" from the "filtering" step. Adopting any competitor's pattern removes the differentiation.

## Strategic Verdict

**Reject** --- The sidebar filter panel solves discoverability but at the cost of VariScout's core differentiator: analysis-integrated filtering. The philosophical conflict with guided frustration pedagogy and Four Lenses coordination is too deep. Better to solve discoverability through onboarding, tooltips, and factor suggestion rather than adopting a pattern that converts the tool from an investigation platform into a dashboard configurator.
