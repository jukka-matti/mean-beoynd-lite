# CHANGE Lens: I-Chart

> The Adaptive Lens — look at the same data through time

The CHANGE lens asks what happens when you arrange your data along a time axis. The same measurements that look fine as an average can reveal shifts, trends, and cycles when viewed through this lens.

## The Question

_"Is the process stable, or is something degrading/shifting over time?"_

---

## What the I-Chart Reveals

- Time-based stability or instability
- Trends, shifts, cycles
- Points outside control limits (UCL/LCL)
- Dynamic behavior: wear, degradation, seasonal effects

---

## Key Insight from Sock Mystery

> "Processes aren't static snapshots; they are moving pictures."

The wash cycle discovery (NEW → WORN → USED) showed how characteristics change over time. The I-Chart is your "time-lapse camera" for the process.

## VariScout Implementation

- Auto-calculated control limits (x̄ ± 2.66MR̄)
- Specification lines overlay (USL/LSL)
- Click any point to see its factor values
- Linked filtering: click a time region → see which factors were active

## The Reality Check

> "What variables are degrading or shifting over time?"

Questions to ask:

- Static vs dynamic analysis
- Cyclical factors (shift patterns, seasonal effects)
- Degradation factors (tool wear, material aging)

## Chart-to-Pillar Reference

| Pillar | Chart   | Key Metric                    | Key Visual                  | User Action               |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| CHANGE | I-Chart | Stability (in/out of control) | Points vs UCL/LCL over time | Click point → see factors |
