# FAILURE Pillar: Pareto

> The Integrity Pillar

---

## The Question

_"Where do problems concentrate? Is 'chaotic data' actually mixed streams?"_

---

## What the Pareto Reveals

- Which categories contain most defects/issues
- The vital few vs trivial many (80/20 rule)
- Hidden patterns in "generic scrap buckets"
- Whether failure modes are being masked

---

## Key Insight from Sock Mystery

> "A 'bad process' is often just a 'badly grouped' process."

Chaotic control charts with Cp < 1.0 weren't bad data — they were mixed subgroups. The Pareto finds the "blood spatter" pattern.

## The Reality Check

> "Is chaotic data masking a 'mixed subgroup' problem?"

Questions to ask:

- The "Chaos" signal (Cp < 1.0)
- Generic scrap buckets
- Multi-modal distributions
