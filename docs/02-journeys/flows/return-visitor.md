## Key Design Principles

### 1. No Login Required

VaRiScout is 100% client-side:

- License key stored in IndexedDB
- Data stored in IndexedDB
- No server-side accounts
- "We don't have your data" (GDPR simple)

### 2. Fast Access from Homepage

Header CTA always visible:

```
[Logo: VaRiScout]  Journey  Cases  Tools ▼  Learn ▼  Pricing  [Try VaRiScout]
```

Return visitors click [Try VaRiScout] → straight to /app

### 3. PWA Install Prompt

For frequent users:

- Prompt to install PWA after 2nd visit
- Installed PWA opens directly (no browser chrome)
- Works offline after initial load

---

## Data Persistence

| What's Saved      | Where           | Retention     |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| License key       | IndexedDB       | Until cleared |
| Uploaded datasets | IndexedDB       | Until deleted |
| Analysis settings | IndexedDB       | Per dataset   |
| Edition branding  | License-derived | N/A           |

---

## Return User Scenarios

### Scenario A: Bookmarked /app

1. User navigates to bookmark
2. PWA loads immediately
3. Previous datasets available
4. Continue working

### Scenario B: Homepage First

1. User goes to variscout.com
2. Sees familiar homepage
3. Clicks [Try VaRiScout]
4. PWA loads with previous data

### Scenario C: PWA Installed

1. User clicks PWA icon on desktop/phone
2. App opens in standalone window
3. No browser UI
4. Previous data available

### Scenario D: New Device

1. User goes to variscout.com on new device
2. Needs to re-enter license key (Settings)
3. Uploads data fresh
4. Continue working

---

## Navigation for Return Visitors

The header is the same for everyone:

```
[Logo]  Journey  Cases  Tools ▼  Learn ▼  Pricing  [Try VaRiScout]
```

But return visitors:

- Ignore most navigation
- Go straight to [Try VaRiScout]
- May check /cases for new content
- May check /pricing for upgrade

---

## Upgrade Path

For free tier users returning:

| Trigger              | Prompt                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Large dataset upload | "Unlock unlimited rows with Pro"         |
| Export attempt       | "Get full export with Pro"               |
| 30-day usage         | "You've analyzed 50 datasets - upgrade?" |

Upgrade prompts should be helpful, not blocking.

---

## CTAs for Return Visitors

| Location           | CTA               | Purpose       |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Header (all pages) | [Try VaRiScout]   | Direct to app |
| PWA (free tier)    | [Upgrade to Pro]  | Conversion    |
| Cases (new)        | "New case study!" | Re-engagement |
| Blog (new)         | "New content"     | Re-engagement |

---

## Mobile Considerations

- PWA install banner on mobile (Add to Home Screen)
- Mobile bookmark works same as desktop
- Data syncs locally only (no cloud)
- Touch-optimized app experience

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric                        | Target |
| ----------------------------- | ------ |
| Return visitor → /app         | >80%   |
| PWA install rate              | >10%   |
| Session frequency (returners) | Track  |
| Free → Paid conversion        | >5%    |
| Data retention (IndexedDB)    | Verify |

---

## Technical Notes

### IndexedDB Storage

- Datasets stored per-project
- Settings stored globally
- License key encrypted at rest
- Clear browser data = lose everything (warn users)

### PWA Manifest

- `display: standalone` for app-like experience
- Offline capability via Service Worker
- App icon on home screen
- Splash screen on launch

### No Account Migration Needed

Since there are no accounts:

- New device = fresh start (except license key re-entry)
- No "forgot password" flow
- No email verification
- Privacy-friendly design
