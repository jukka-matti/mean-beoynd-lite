# Boxplot

The Boxplot is VariScout's tool for the **FLOW** pillar - comparing variation across factors.

---

## Purpose

_"Which upstream inputs explain the variation I see downstream?"_

The Boxplot reveals:

- Comparison across factors (Machine A vs B vs C)
- Between-group vs within-group variation
- Which subgroup contributes most variation
- The "soup ingredients" that create the output

## Key Elements

| Element     | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Box         | Interquartile range (IQR, 25th-75th percentile) |
| Median line | Middle value (50th percentile)                  |
| Whiskers    | Extend to 1.5×IQR from box                      |
| Outliers    | Points beyond whiskers                          |

## ANOVA Statistics

When comparing factors, VariScout calculates:

| Statistic        | Description                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| F-statistic      | Ratio of between/within variance |
| p-value          | Probability of chance difference |
| η² (eta-squared) | Proportion of variance explained |

---

## Interpretation

| Pattern               | Meaning                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Non-overlapping boxes | Significant difference          |
| High η²               | Factor explains much variation  |
| Wide box              | High variation within group     |
| Many outliers         | Check data quality or subgroups |

## Linked Filtering

Click any box to:

- Filter all charts to that subgroup
- See I-Chart for just that factor level
- Continue drill-down analysis

## Technical Reference

VariScout's implementation:

```typescript
// From @variscout/core
import { calculateAnova, getEtaSquared } from '@variscout/core';

const anova = calculateAnova(data, 'Machine', 'Weight');
// Returns: { fStatistic, pValue, etaSquared, groups }

const etaSq = getEtaSquared(data, 'Machine', 'Weight');
// Returns: number (0-1)
```

**Test coverage:** See `packages/core/src/__tests__/stats.test.ts` for ANOVA tests.
