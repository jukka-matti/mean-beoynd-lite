# Regression Analysis

Regression is VariScout's tool for exploring relationships between continuous variables.

---

## Purpose

_"Is there a relationship between X and Y?"_

Regression answers:

- Does X predict Y?
- How strong is the relationship?
- What's the direction (positive/negative)?

## Key Metrics

| Metric      | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| R²          | Proportion of variance explained (0-1) |
| Adjusted R² | R² adjusted for number of predictors   |
| Slope       | Change in Y per unit X                 |
| Intercept   | Y value when X = 0                     |
| p-value     | Significance of relationship           |

---

## Interpretation Guide

| R² Value  | Interpretation |
| --------- | -------------- |
| 0.90-1.00 | Very strong    |
| 0.70-0.89 | Strong         |
| 0.50-0.69 | Moderate       |
| 0.30-0.49 | Weak           |
| <0.30     | Very weak      |

## Use in VariScout

!!! note
Regression in VariScout serves as a **first step** to visually check if correlation exists. It answers "is there a relationship?" before investing in deeper predictive modeling.

For most variation analysis, the Four Pillars (I-Chart, Boxplot, Pareto, Capability) are sufficient.

## Multiple Regression

When using multiple predictors:

| Metric      | Purpose                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Adjusted R² | Compare models with different predictors |
| VIF         | Check for multicollinearity              |
| p-values    | Significance of each predictor           |

### When to Use Multiple Regression

Use multiple regression when:

- You have **multiple potential predictors** (X variables)
- You want to understand **which factors matter most**
- You need to **control for confounding variables**
- You're building a **predictive model**

### VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

VIF detects **multicollinearity** - when predictors are correlated with each other.

| VIF Value | Interpretation | Action                      |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1         | No correlation | Ideal                       |
| 1-5       | Moderate       | Usually acceptable          |
| 5-10      | High           | Investigate                 |
| >10       | Severe         | Remove predictor or combine |

**Why multicollinearity matters:**

- Inflates coefficient standard errors
- Makes individual predictor effects unreliable
- Model still predicts well, but interpretation is compromised

### Interpreting Coefficients

| Element        | Meaning                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coefficient    | Change in Y per unit change in X (holding others constant) |
| Standard Error | Uncertainty in coefficient estimate                        |
| t-statistic    | Coefficient / Standard Error                               |
| p-value        | Probability of seeing this t if true effect is zero        |

### Model Selection Tips

1. **Start simple** - Add predictors one at a time
2. **Check Adjusted R²** - Does adding a predictor improve it?
3. **Monitor VIF** - Remove highly correlated predictors
4. **Validate** - Test on held-out data if possible

## Interaction Effects

Interactions occur when one factor's effect **depends on another factor's level**.

_Example: "Machine C is only problematic on Night shift"_

### Why Check for Interactions?

Sequential drill-down (ANOVA) captures **main effects** only. If factors interact:

- Main effects may underestimate total explained variation
- The combination matters more than individual factors
- Action should target the specific combination, not factors separately

### Enabling Interactions in VariScout

1. Switch to **Advanced (GLM)** mode in Regression Panel
2. Select categorical predictors (factors from drill-down)
3. Toggle **"Include interactions"** checkbox
4. Review the ANOVA table for significant interaction terms

### Coming from Variation Funnel

When drilling 2+ factors, the Variation Funnel shows a guidance prompt:

> "Your drill-down shows main effects. To check if factors interact,
> use the Regression Panel with 'Include interactions'."

Click **"Check Interactions →"** to navigate directly to Regression Panel.

### Interpreting Interaction Terms

| Term              | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Shift*Machine`   | Effect of Shift depends on Machine level |
| p-value < 0.05    | Significant interaction exists           |
| Large coefficient | Strong interaction effect                |

## Technical Reference

VariScout's implementation:

```typescript
// From @variscout/core
import { calculateRegression, calculateMultiRegression } from '@variscout/core';

// Simple regression
const result = calculateRegression(data, 'X', 'Y');

// Multiple regression with interactions
const multiResult = calculateMultiRegression(data, ['X1', 'X2'], 'Y', {
  includeInteractions: true,
});
```

**Test coverage:** See `packages/core/src/__tests__/stats.test.ts` for regression tests.
