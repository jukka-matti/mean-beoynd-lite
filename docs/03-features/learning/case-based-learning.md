# Case-Based Learning

Learning through real-world examples and the 3-act case structure.

## Philosophy

> "Let them fail so they ask why."

VariScout uses "guided frustration" pedagogy:

1. **Phase 1: Immersion in Chaos** — See the messy data
2. **Phase 2: Physical Stratification** — Peel back layers
3. **Phase 3: System Understanding** — Connect to real system

## 3-Act Case Structure

Every case follows this narrative arc:

### Act 1: The Setup

- Present the problem as management sees it
- Show the averages, the dashboard view
- "Line B is 3% under target"
- Create cognitive dissonance: "But wait..."

### Act 2: Your Turn

- Interactive demo with the case data
- User explores freely
- Some hints available if stuck
- "Can you find where the 46% is hiding?"

### Act 3: The Solution

- Scroll-based reveal of the analysis journey
- Step by step: I-Chart → Boxplot → Pareto → Drill-down
- The "aha moment": "46% was in Machine C, Shift 2"
- Methodology connection: This is the Four Pillars in action

## Teaching Flow

```
WEEK N: Analysis reveals a problem
         ↓
"Bed C has high moisture"
         ↓
WEEK N+1: "But wait..."
         ↓
"Can we trust this measurement?"
         ↓
GAGE R&R STUDY → Validate or fix MSA
```
