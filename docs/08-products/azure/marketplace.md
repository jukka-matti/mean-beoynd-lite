## Offer Type

### Managed Application (Required for Billing)

VariScout uses the **Managed Application** offer type:

```
Azure Application > Managed Application
├── Deploys ARM template to customer subscription (managed RG)
├── Customer has full access to deployed resources
├── Publisher management DISABLED (zero access)
├── Microsoft handles billing (3% fee)
└── Monthly pricing at €150/month
```

**Why Managed Application (not Solution Template):**

- **Solution Templates are not transactable** — Microsoft will not bill customers for them
- Managed Applications support Microsoft-billed monthly subscriptions
- Customer still controls their deployment (publisher access disabled)
- Data stays in customer environment
- No backend needed

**Permission configuration:**

| Setting              | Value        | Notes                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Publisher Management | **Disabled** | No publisher access to customer resources |
| Customer Access      | **Enabled**  | Full customer control                     |

These settings are **immutable after publishing**.

### Deployment Package

Partner Center requires a `.zip` package for Managed Application offers:

```
variscout-managed-app.zip
├── mainTemplate.json         # ARM template for resources
└── createUiDefinition.json   # Azure portal deployment wizard UI
```

See [ARM Template Documentation](arm-template.md) for the full template.
