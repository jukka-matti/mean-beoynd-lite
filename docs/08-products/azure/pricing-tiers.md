## Pricing Rationale

### Why Single Plan

Managed Applications on Azure Marketplace are **per-deployment**, not per-user. There is no mechanism to enforce different user-count tiers within a tenant. A single all-inclusive plan:

- Is simpler to market and purchase
- Eliminates "which tier do I need?" confusion
- Requires no user-count enforcement logic
- Aligns with the per-deployment billing model

### Why €150/month

€150/month (€1,800/year equivalent) is competitive with established SPC tools while reflecting the value of unlimited tenant-wide access:

- Cheaper than Minitab for any team size (Minitab charges per-seat)
- Comparable to SigmaXL for 2+ users
- Significantly cheaper than InfinityQS for any team
- No hidden infrastructure costs (runs on customer's Azure)

For a team of 10 users: €15/user/month — well below any competitor.

## Free Tier (Excel Add-in & PWA)

Non-paying users still get value through:

| Product          | Price | Features                                       |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Excel Add-in** | Free  | Core SPC: I-Chart, Boxplot, Pareto, Capability |
| **PWA**          | Free  | Demo only: all features with sample data       |

The Excel Add-in serves as a marketing funnel — users who need Performance Mode, Gage R&R, or team collaboration upgrade to the Azure App.
