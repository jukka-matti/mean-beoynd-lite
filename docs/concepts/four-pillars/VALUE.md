# VALUE Pillar: Capability Histogram (The Alignment Pillar)

> Part of [Watson's Four Pillars](./OVERVIEW.md)

---

## The Question

_"Are we measuring what the customer actually experiences? Do we meet their specs?"_

---

## What the Capability Histogram Reveals

- Distribution shape (normal, bimodal, skewed)
- Position relative to specifications (USL/LSL/Target)
- Cp/Cpk metrics (process capability)
- Pass/fail percentage

---

## Key Insight from Sock Mystery

> "If you get Value wrong, the rest of the analysis is meaningless."

The demand for "consistent length" only made sense within a size category. Rational subgroups must align with how customers experience variation.

---

## VaRiScout Implementation

- Specification limit inputs (USL/LSL/Target)
- Cp/Cpk calculation with visual indicators
- Distribution overlay on histogram
- Multi-tier grading support (coffee A/B/C grades, etc.)

## The Reality Check

> "Are we measuring what the customer actually experiences?"

Questions to ask:

- Customer vs Machine CTQ
- Relative vs Absolute specs
- The "So What?" test
