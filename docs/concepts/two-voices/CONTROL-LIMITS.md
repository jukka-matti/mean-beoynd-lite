## What Control Limits Tell You

| Question                 | Answer                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Where do they come from? | **Calculated from your data** (typically x̄ ± 3σ) |
| What do they represent?  | The natural variation of YOUR process            |
| Who sets them?           | The process itself — through its behavior        |
| Can you change them?     | Only by changing the process                     |

## The Voice of the Process Says:

> "Given how I currently operate, this is the range of output you can expect from me. Points within my control limits are my normal behavior. Points outside mean something has changed."

## Control Limits Are NOT:

- ❌ Goals or targets
- ❌ What you want the process to do
- ❌ Customer requirements
- ❌ Arbitrary lines you can move
- ❌ Good/bad boundaries

---

## Control Limits ARE:

- ✅ Calculated from actual process data
- ✅ The process speaking for itself
- ✅ Stability indicators
- ✅ A baseline for detecting change
- ✅ Unique to YOUR process
