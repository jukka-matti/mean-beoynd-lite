# Two Voices: Understanding Control Limits vs Specification Limits

> A VaRiScout educational resource based on ITC Quality Control principles

## The Two Voices

Every process has two voices speaking at the same time:

| Voice                     | What It Says                      | Expressed As                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Voice of the Process**  | "This is what I actually produce" | Control Limits (UCL/LCL)       |
| **Voice of the Customer** | "This is what I need"             | Specification Limits (USL/LSL) |

**The critical insight:** These two voices are independent. The process doesn't know what the customer wants. The customer doesn't know what the process can do.

## The Two Voices Together

The power comes from listening to BOTH voices — and the **goal** is getting them aligned:

## The Goal: Control Limits Within Spec Limits

The ultimate objective of process improvement:

```
USL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  Voice of Customer


         UCL ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─             Voice of Process
                   ●●●●●●●●●●●●                        (INSIDE customer
         x̄   ══════════════════════════               requirements)
                   ●●●●●●●●●●●●
         LCL ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─


LSL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  Voice of Customer
```

**When control limits fit within spec limits:**

- Process naturally produces what customer needs
- No inspection needed — every unit is good
- Stable AND capable = predictable quality
- This is the target state

**The journey:**

| State                            | What It Means                             | Action                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Control limits outside specs     | Process can't meet requirements naturally | Fundamental improvement needed |
| Control limits touch specs       | Barely capable, at risk                   | Reduce variation               |
| Control limits within specs      | Process naturally meets requirements      | ✅ Maintain                    |
| Control limits well within specs | Robust capability, room for drift         | Ideal state                    |

**Why this sequence matters:**

| Order                     | What Happens                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stability THEN Capability | You understand what the process naturally does, then compare to requirements          |
| Capability THEN Stability | You chase numbers without understanding the process — any "improvement" is accidental |

## Summary

| Concept              | Control Limits           | Specification Limits                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Voice**            | Process                  | Customer                                  |
| **Source**           | Calculated from data     | Defined by requirements                   |
| **Question**         | "Is it stable?"          | "Does it meet needs?"                     |
| **Chart**            | I-Chart                  | Capability (and I-Chart when specs added) |
| **Can change?**      | Only by changing process | Only by negotiating                       |
| **VaRiScout Pillar** | CHANGE                   | VALUE                                     |

**The key insight:**

> Listen to both voices. The process tells you what it CAN do. The customer tells you what it MUST do. The goal is alignment — control limits within spec limits. VaRiScout helps you see both voices and find WHERE to focus when they don't align.
