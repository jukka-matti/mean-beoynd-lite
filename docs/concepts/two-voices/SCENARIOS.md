# Four Scenarios: When the Voices Align (or Don't)

> Part of [Two Voices](./OVERVIEW.md)

---

## Scenario 1: Stable AND Capable ✅

```
USL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
UCL ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─
         ●●●●●●●●●●●●
x̄   ══════════════════════════════
         ●●●●●●●●●●●●
LCL ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─
LSL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

| Voice of Process | Voice of Customer   | Status         |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| "I'm stable"     | "You meet my needs" | ✅ Ideal state |

**Action:** Maintain. Monitor. Don't over-adjust.

---

## Scenario 2: Stable but NOT Capable ⚠️

```
USL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
         ●●●●●●●●●●●●            } Some output
x̄   ══════════════════════════════  } exceeds specs
         ●●●●●●●●●●●●            }
LSL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

| Voice of Process               | Voice of Customer         | Status                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| "I'm stable — this is my best" | "You don't meet my needs" | ⚠️ Fundamental problem |

**Action:** The process IS stable — this is what it naturally produces. You cannot "try harder." You must **fundamentally change the process** (equipment, method, materials) or **renegotiate specs** with customer.

---

## Scenario 3: Capable but NOT Stable ⚠️

```
USL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                        ●        } Unstable points
         ●●●●●●●●●●               } but within
x̄   ══════════════════════════════  } spec limits
              ●●●●●●●●●          }
                    ●            }
LSL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

| Voice of Process    | Voice of Customer             | Status   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| "I'm unpredictable" | "You meet my needs (for now)" | ⚠️ Risky |

**Action:** Dangerous situation! Currently meeting specs but not predictable. A special cause could push output outside specs at any time. **Find and remove the instability sources** before disaster.

---

## Scenario 4: Neither Stable NOR Capable ❌

```
         ●                       } Chaos
USL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
              ●    ●             } AND
         ●        ●   ●          } failing
x̄   ══════════════════════════════  } specs
      ●       ●        ●         }
                  ●              }
LSL ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
              ●                  }
```

| Voice of Process    | Voice of Customer         | Status    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| "I'm unpredictable" | "You don't meet my needs" | ❌ Crisis |

**Action:** **Stabilize first, then improve capability.** Trying to fix capability while unstable is futile — you're chasing variation, not understanding it.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confusing the Two Limits

❌ "Our UCL is 15 because that's the max the customer accepts"

✅ "Our USL is 15 (customer requirement). Our UCL is 13.2 (calculated from our data)."

---

### Mistake 2: Adjusting Process to Hit Spec Limits

❌ "We're at 14.8, getting close to the USL of 15. Better adjust down!"

✅ "Is that point within our control limits? If yes, it's normal variation — don't adjust. If no, find out why."

**Tampering with a stable process increases variation.**

---

### Mistake 3: Celebrating When Within Spec

❌ "All our output is within spec! We're done!"

✅ "Is the process stable? If not, we're lucky today but at risk tomorrow."

---

### Mistake 4: Setting Control Limits from Specs

❌ "Let's set our control limits at ±10% of the spec limit"

✅ "Control limits must be calculated from actual process data. They cannot be chosen."
